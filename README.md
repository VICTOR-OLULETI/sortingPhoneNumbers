# sortingPhoneNumbers
This is a java application that generates a summary report with the total number of phone numbers for each service provider.
Attached to the project is a text file containing 1 million phone numbers.
If you uncomment some part of the code, it would further categorize the each service provider number into its different files.
Thanks.
